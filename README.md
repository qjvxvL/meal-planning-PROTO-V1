# Meal Planning Prototype

A tiny static prototype that demonstrates a simple weekly meal planner. Each day offers two meal options and lists the required ingredients. Users can toggle between the options for any day and refresh the entire weekly menu once for fresh inspiration.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in a browser to explore the planner. No build tools or dependencies are required.

## Features

- **Weekly overview** for seven days including meal name and ingredients.
- **Two choices per day** with an inline toggle that cycles between the available options.
- **Single-use refresh** button that swaps in a new themed weekly plan and then disables itself.
